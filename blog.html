                    <h2> AR Web Experimentals and Possibilities</h2>
                    <p>There are lots of projects and frameworks developed for augmented reality realization. While some of them provide stable tracking features and tools such as object recognition, face recognition, and basic occlusion, most of these features have high requirements for the environment (lighting, geometry, camera movement, etc.). I found AR.js to be one of the most mentioned and experimented free web AR interfaces. It is built upon aframe and three.js, which are mature and highly recognized APIs for generating three dimensional geometries and animations on web pages. Aframe is also natively used for virtual reality development.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>AR.js’s basic logistics was built on the VR setup of aframe. With the help of the access to the device’s sensors, augmented reality features can be easily realized, and object rendering is solely based upon the underlying three.js interface. It is free and easy to use. It is extremely simple to recreate fundamental AR functionalities. However, as a result of its simplicity and free of charge (I mean it’s already good enough! What else can you ask for? It’s free!)AR.js is definitely not the best option when it comes to nature feature detection(NFT) based image tracking and location based AR. Image tracking doesn’t work all the time. I tried to choose some great images with a high complexity yet they still don't function efficiently enough for the model to have a stable visibility. The location based AR is based upon geolocation, and the example asks you to directly type in your latitude and longitude to see the 3d model right next to you. One of the biggest disadvantages of location based is that it requires a high precision on the device’s location service, which would not be satisfied especially when you’re testing and working inside a shelter. It takes great effort both physically and mentally for you to be determined to work outside in the sun, holding your laptop and sitting on the grass, testing out this very specific feature. You could suffer from dehydration and exhaustion and the potential of being fired by your boss long before you can figure out how this location based system works. So screw it. Testing outside once in a while is also not an option since it doesn’t fit my workflow and I just hate people telling me to go outside. I tried following <a href="https://medium.com/chialab-open-source/build-your-location-based-augmented-reality-web-app-c2442e716564">this tutorial</a> and using geolocation in javascript to get the user’s live longitude and latitude and spawn a magnemite right in front of the user. But it doesn’t work and I can’t find my cute floating magnemite. I am very disappointed. Period.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>On the other hand, the marker based system is working just fine. Being the biggest selling point of AR.js, it is satisfying to use. The marker itself is fairly easy to create--you just add your desired picture into the instantiater provided on the website, and it will give you the resulting marker. The models on these markers are stable compared to the nft image, and tracking multiple markers would not affect the precision of marker detection as well. There are even systems of multi-markers to increase the model stability(<a href="https://medium.com/arjs/area-learning-with-multi-markers-in-ar-js-1ff03a2f9fbe">read-this</a>). This marker system also supports barcode and QR code; it has a great potential to be utilized to add more interaction to products and services.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the samples that I created, three are all based on AR.js markers. The first example is a recreation of the minimal example that demonstrates the basic functionality of rendering an animated cube on top of the marker.
                        The second example shows the possibility of combining ar scene with basic html widgets. The user can write notes in the text area and the content will be stored in the user’s local browser storage and will be shown on the note on the marker. To see the note, you need to click on the marker first. The canvas showing the camera view may not be able to be scaled even if you added the “embedded” tag on <a-scene>. You can use “iframe“ to get around that part.
                        The third example is a more interactive “game” (I guess it is a game despite being so simple and meaningless). There will be a block on top of the marker. By clicking and dragging on the block, the player could instantiate new blocks with random color and stack them up to build their own toy city (好耶！）. This is realized by utilizing the aframe physics system and some extras pulled from github. It can work on both mobile and desktop browsers. The game demonstrates the possibility of building a more complex and complete interactive AR game. Some restrictions and defects arise when building these games, and I realize that the aframe API is not stable enough (especially newer versions), many related packages only support ancient aframe versions and will report errors once switched to newer versions. The resources out there are limited for aframe; therefore, maybe three.js is the better choice. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>AR.js, just like all other web based AR interfaces, has drawbacks that are yet to be overcome. Latency and bandwidth are hard problems to be tackled in the future, when the overall technological support of the internet has been improved. As of now, pure front end AR cannot handle frequent file accessing and large numbers of object rendering. Augmented reality, mixed reality, and virtual reality have always been hot topics in the research and development worlds, but remarkable progress is yet to be made. Hopefully this will change in the next five to ten years; or maybe the evolution of human technology would branch to a completely different direction--neurolinks and chip implantation.</p>
